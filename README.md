# MASM-Tic-Tac-Toe

An implementation of Tic Tac Toe game by:
    - Ajay Krishna K V,         Roll No.: 07
    - Nanda Kishor M Pai,       Roll No.: 45
    - Paurnami Pradeep,         Roll No.: 50
    - Sudev Suresh Sreedevi,    Roll No.: 60

## How it works

The position of the characters in the string which 
draws the tic tac toe board is initialised on game start. 
Then, on every turn, the corresponding blank is replaced by
either an X or a O depending upon which player is playing.
